# messenger-visualizer

Eventually this repo should contain a webapp. But for now let's figure out what type of visualizations look good.

Personal facebook messenger data can be downloaded from https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=your_facebook_information and then <b>"Download your information"</b>. Be sure to choose JSON format, set media quality to low (if you want to generate and download data faster) and set date range to <b>"All time"</b>. You should choose just <b>"Messages"</b> in the <b>"Select information to Download"</b> section.

We are mostly interested in the contents of folder ```messages/inbox```.

In there every single message ever sent on messenger.
